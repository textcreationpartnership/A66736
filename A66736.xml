            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. A woman that <hi>feareth the Lord,</hi> that is, who is ſincerely religious, good in good earneſt. Nothing is more frequent or obvious in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than ſuch <hi>Synechdoches,</hi> as put one eminent Grace for all the Chain of Graces. So ſometimes the <hi>Love</hi> of God, ſometimes <hi>Truſt</hi> in God, and moſt commonly the <hi>Fear</hi> of God is put for being truly religious, or is made the Periphraſis of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man. As in that ſignal promiſe of the New Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 39, 40. <hi>They ſhall be my people, and I will be their God, and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may</hi> fear <hi>me for ever, for the

And I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, and I will put my</hi> fear <hi>in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Job. 1.1. <hi>There was a man in the land of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z., whoſe name was Job, and that man was perfect and upright, one that</hi> feared <hi>God, and eſchewed evil:</hi> ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one that</hi> feareth <hi>God, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheweth evil,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>Doth Job</hi> fear <hi>God, for nought?</hi> Eccl. 12, 13.

He honoureth them that fear the Lord; where the godly Man is under this Denomination of one that <hi>feareth the Lord,</hi> oppoſed to the wicked, called there a vile perſon. 'Tis alſo an infallible ſign of the preſence of all other Graces, in the excerciſe of which true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs conſiſts; for as the <hi>Law</hi> is copulative, ſo are the <hi>Graces</hi> by which we obey it, and as where the <hi>Soul</hi> is, diſcovering it ſelf by

            <p>For ſhe was truly excellent, and great in all reſpects: <hi>great</hi> in the honour of her <hi>Birth,</hi> being born a <hi>Lady,</hi> and a <hi>Virtuoſa</hi> both, Seventh Daughter of that eminently Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Richard,</hi> the firſt Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> who being born a private <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> and younger Brother of a younger Brother, to no other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage than is expreſſed in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> and <hi>Motto,</hi> which his humble Gratitude inſcribed on all the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he built.</p>

            <p>This Noble Lord by his prudent and pious Conſort, no leſs an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and Honour to their Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendants than himſelf, was bleſſed with five Sons, of which he lived to ſee four Lords, and Peers of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

            <p>And eight Daughters.</p>
            <p>And that you may remark how all things were extraordinary in this great Perſonage: it will, I hope, be neither unpleaſant, nor impertinent, to add a ſhort Story, I had from our Lady's own mouth.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Boyl</hi> after Earl of <hi>Cork</hi> (who was then a Widdower) came one morning to wait upon Sir <hi>Jeof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry Fenton,</hi> at that time a great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of State in the Kingdom of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34084:32"/>
               <hi>Ireland;</hi> who being ingaged in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and not knowing who it was who deſired to ſpeak with him, a while delayed him acceſs, which time he ſpent pleaſantly with his young Daughter in her Nurſes Arms. But when Sir <hi>Jeoffry</hi> came, and ſaw whom he had made ſtay ſomewhat long, he civilly excuſed it. But Maſter <hi>Boyl</hi> replyed, he had been very well entertained, and ſpent his time much to his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in courting his Daughter, if he might obtain the Honour to be accepted for his Son-in-law. At which Sir <hi>Jeoffry</hi> ſmiling, (to hear one who had been formerly marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, move for a Wife carried in Arms, and under two years old) asked him, if he would ſtay for her: to which he frankly anſwered him he would, and Sir <hi>Jeoffry</hi> as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, promiſed him, he ſhould then have his full conſent. And they both kept their words honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. And by this virtuous Lady he had thirteen Children, ten of which he lived to ſee honourably married, and died a Grandfather by the youngeſt of them.</p>

                  <p>AS ſoon as I awaked, I bleſſed God. When I had read in the <hi>Word,</hi> the Chapters of the Sufferings of my <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> I ſpent much time in meditating of his <hi>dying love.</hi> By which thoughts I found my heart much drawn out
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34084:42"/>to <hi>love</hi> him, and <hi>melted</hi> by his <hi>love,</hi> then with great and awful apprehenſions of <hi>God</hi> upon my heart, I went to <hi>pray.</hi> In which <hi>duty</hi> my <hi>heart</hi> was lifted up in the high <hi>praiſes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for both ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and temporal mercies: and my <hi>affections</hi> were much drawn out in the <hi>duty,</hi> in which my <hi>heart</hi> did follow exceeding hard after <hi>God</hi> for a nearer communion with him in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> than ever yet I had. I then renewed my <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with <hi>God:</hi> and made promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that by his <hi>Grace</hi> enabling me, I would walk more cloſely with him for the time to come. That which in eſpecial manner I begged of God at this <hi>Sacrament</hi> was more <hi>love</hi> to him, more <hi>holineſs,</hi> more <hi>contempt</hi> of the World, and the Glories of it, that I might be more <hi>uſeful</hi> to the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> of my Fellow-<hi>Chriſtians</hi> than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I had been.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>mercies</hi> which in eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, I was grateful for, were, the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> of the World, and for the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and for

                     <hi>converting Grace,</hi> and for <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and for ſome meaſure of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification:</hi> and for ſo much <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> exerciſed toward me, <hi>before</hi> my <hi>converſion:</hi> and in order to it, <hi>imbittering Creature-comforts,</hi> that I might ſeek for <hi>comforts above:</hi> and for a <hi>ſanctified affliction,</hi> and for ſome degree of <hi>patience</hi> to bear it, and for ſupports under it by the warm and lively <hi>comforts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and for <hi>returns</hi> of <hi>prayer:</hi> and for ſo many <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities</hi> to ſeek unto God: and for the ſweet <hi>reviving</hi> hours I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>ſolitude</hi> by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Meditations:</hi> and for the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and the <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying motions</hi> of <hi>God's Spirit.</hi> I was in a more than uſual manner <hi>melted</hi> in the <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>ſhed</hi> a very great plenty of <hi>tears</hi> in it: which when I came from, I found a <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> deſire to partake of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and a <hi>great joy</hi> that I was going to partake of it. Then I went to hear—the Text was <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh to the Father, but by me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:34084:43"/>
                  <p>I was attentive at that good Sermon. And by what I heard of the <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had my <hi>heart</hi> much warmed with <hi>love</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, at the <hi>confeſſion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I found my <hi>heart</hi> in a more than uſual manner <hi>broken</hi> for my ſins, which I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed</hi> with great plenty of <hi>tears,</hi> and from my <hi>heart judged,</hi> and <hi>loathed</hi> my ſelf for them. After I had received, I found my <hi>heart</hi> in an extraordinary manner <hi>warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And my <hi>Soul did follow very hard after him,</hi> to be made more <hi>holy,</hi> and for <hi>Grace</hi> to ſerve him better than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet I had done. I had very <hi>lively</hi> affections in the <hi>duty;</hi> in which I received much joy, and had ſweet communion with God in it.</p>
                  <p>After I had at the <hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> given to the Poor, I came from the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with my <hi>heart</hi> in a ſweet grateful, and Heavenly Frame, and then in private <hi>bleſſed God,</hi> for that <hi>bleſſed Feaſt,</hi> and begged ſtrength
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34084:44"/>to keep my promiſes I had made to <hi>God,</hi> of new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>In the Afternoon I heard again the ſame perſon, upon the ſame <hi>Text;</hi> I was in an attentive, ſerious frame at that good Sermon. The Subject of which was to ſhew, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the only <hi>way</hi> for <hi>penitent ſinners</hi> to come unto the Father.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>meditated</hi> upon the Sermons, and <hi>prayed</hi> them over. And had alſo <hi>meditations</hi> of the <hi>Joys</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> with the thoughts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever <hi>freed from ſin,</hi> and of being ever with the Lord, where I ſhould <hi>enjoy him</hi> in his <hi>fulleſt love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I found my <hi>heart</hi> much <hi>revived</hi> and my <hi>Soul</hi> did then make ſtrong <hi>Sallies</hi> and <hi>Egreſſes</hi> after that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Family Duties were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, at which I prayed with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency; I did before going to Bed commit my ſelf to <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>O Lord,</hi> I do from my Soul bleſs thee for this ſweet day, in which thou wert pleaſed to vouchſafe

               <hi>She</hi> was a very <hi>ſerious and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive hearer of the Word,</hi> and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after Sermon <hi>recollected</hi> what ſhe heard, ſometimes by <hi>writing,</hi> always by <hi>thinking</hi> and calling it to mind, that ſhe might make it her own, and turn it into practice, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be a <hi>forgetful fruitleſs hearer</hi> only, <hi>but a doer, that ſhe might be bleſſed in her deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch ſhe was for the <hi>external</hi> performances of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this was <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>lovely,</hi> yet her <hi>chief glory was within, in the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,</hi> in that <hi>dreſs of Graces</hi> which adorned her Soul; this ſtring was all of Orient Pearls, and evenly matched, not one ill wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or of unequal ſize. There was not one <hi>dryed</hi> or <hi>withered</hi> Limb, one member <hi>wanting</hi> or <hi>defective</hi> in the new creature, ſhe was <hi>complete in Chriſt,</hi> all of a piece.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Head</hi> of her Knowledge was <hi>comprehenſive</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> The <hi>Eye</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:34084:45"/>of her Faith was <hi>piercing</hi> and <hi>ſteddy.</hi> The <hi>Ear</hi> of her obedience was <hi>open</hi> and <hi>light of hearing, and boared at the door poſts of wiſdom's houſe.</hi> Her <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> was <hi>ſavoury,</hi> and <hi>reliſhing,</hi> to which God's Law was <hi>ſweeter than the honey, and the honey-comb, and more eſteemed than her neceſſary food.</hi> The <hi>Cheeks</hi> of her Modeſty were <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>ruddy.</hi> The <hi>Arms</hi> of her deſires were <hi>ſtretched out after God,</hi> and <hi>flexile,</hi> to embrace him. The <hi>Hands</hi> of her <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> were <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>open.</hi> The <hi>Breaſts</hi> of her Bounty were <hi>well-faſhioned;</hi> and <hi>full of milk,</hi> and the Bowels of her compaſſion were <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Her <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> was even <hi>greedy</hi> and <hi>inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> The <hi>heart</hi> of her ſincerity was <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>lively,</hi> and the <hi>pulſe</hi> of her conſcience <hi>ſmooth</hi> and <hi>equal.</hi> The <hi>feet</hi> of her affections were <hi>ſwifter than the Roes on the Mountains of Bether,</hi> more truly winged than the Poets feign their <hi>Mercuries.</hi> The <hi>natural heat</hi> of her Zeal more <hi>fervent than the coals of Juniper,</hi> and the <hi>radical moiſture</hi> of her repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance more <hi>fluid</hi> than the <hi>ſprings of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34084:45"/>Piſgah.</hi> Being ſeen with dry eyes, under tear-moving circumſtances, which very nearly concern'd her ſelf, and being asked, how ſhe could refrain? She replied, <hi>I deſire to weep for nothing but my ſin:.</hi> Her <hi>name was as ointment pouned forth,</hi> which made her the delight and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all good men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; yea, you may call her a <hi>She Jedidiah,</hi> a <hi>Female Lemuel,</hi> the Lord's delights, ſhe with whom God was.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Soul</hi> of this excellent <hi>Body,</hi> which animated all its goodly parts within, was the <hi>love of God,</hi> and the gorgeous Robe which cloathed it without, was her <hi>deep humility.</hi> Theſe were the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> in this great Firmament, all whoſe <hi>Stars</hi> were of the <hi>firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and the <hi>leaſt</hi> of which would have made the great Luminary in another Orb. Such was this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Spouſe of Chriſt, ſo like her Heavenly Bridegroom, that for that reſemblance ſake, we may ſay of her ſhe was exceeding lovely.</p>
            <p>Nor was ſhe leſs ſolicitous to make others good, than to be ſo her ſelf. She well remembred our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34084:46"/>Saviours charge to S. <hi>Peter, When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> She ſet her heart to build God's ſpiritual Temple, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe applied her ſelf to it with all her might. She had holy Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for the Glory of God, and ſhe was a great Lover of Souls, and thoſe two engaged her to promote Religion with utmoſt induſtry and zeal, which that ſhe might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh more advantageouſly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>She</hi> avowedly deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent <hi>Religion</hi> as <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>taking,</hi> and <hi>free from vulgar prejudice,</hi> as poſſibly ſhe might; not ſo as might affright and ſcare men from it: but that it might <hi>allure</hi> them, and <hi>inſinuate</hi> it's ſelf into their love and liking: to this end ſhe was <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable, familiar, pleaſant,</hi> of a <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> converſation, <hi>unaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> not <hi>ſour, reſerved, moroſe, ſad, dejected, melancholy,</hi> which preſents Religion moſt diſadvantageouſly. She was naturally of the ſweeteſt temper in the World: and <hi>Grace</hi> inoculated into ſuch a ſtock, thrives even luxuriantly. Whereas ſome <hi>crabbed, peeviſh, ſullen</hi> natures ſtarve
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34084:46"/>the beſt Cien they are grafted with. As I remember one of whom 'twas uſually ſaid, he had Grace enough for ſeven other men, yet ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for himſelf. And ſhe made <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> both ſubſervient to the good of others.</p>
            <p>As we ſay of ſome neat, well-faſhion'd perſons, what e're they wear becomes them, and ſits well: I muſt do her this right, to teſtifie, I never ſaw Religion become any perſon better. And 'twas hard not to approve and love a dreſs ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and adorning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>She</hi> kept her ſelf <hi>free</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed</hi> from all Parties and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that none might ſuſpect a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of making Proſelytes to any, but to God.</p>
            <p>She was neither of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos,</hi> nor <hi>Cephas,</hi> but only Chriſt. Her name was <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and her Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name <hi>Catholick,</hi> ſhe had a large and unconfined Soul, not hemm'd in, or pounded up within the Circle of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man's name or drawing, a <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>She was a moſt incomparable Mother, which appeared in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of one Son of her Body, and three Daughters of her Soul; for ſo I may truly ſpeak.

            <p>Some ſcarcely known to any but my ſelf, and it may be had not been to me, but to ask my judgment, whether it might be reduced to the account of charity, to give to ſuch and ſuch, being in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For ſhe was never leſs tender of their modeſty than compaſſionate of their neceſſity, and was more ſollicitous for their pardon, than their thanks, for helping them.</p>

            <p n="3">3. A <hi>great many young Scholars</hi> of hopeful promiſing Parts, whom ſhe wholly or in good meaſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated at the Univerſity, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome thirty, ſome twenty, ſome ten, ſome eight, many five pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and ſome others who had more aſſiſtance, leſs.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:34084:62"/>
            <p n="4">4. Abundance of young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which ſhe put to School in the neighbouring Towns, I cannot ſay how many, but rather <hi>ſans</hi> number, all that were poor and willing to learn: Nay; that could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it, whoſe Schooling ſhe did not only pay for, but gave them both Books and often Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and not only near home but as far as <hi>Wales,</hi> contributing nobly to that pious deſign, of that good old man and indefatigable promoter of it Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> ſo <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply atteſted by a Cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> beyond exception, to reſcue <hi>Wales</hi> from its remaining ignorance and demi-Barbariſm.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Many <hi>Miniſters</hi> of both denominations, as well <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> whoſe livings were ſo ſmall as not to yield them a ſubſiſtance, as thoſe who had none at all.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Many <hi>occaſional Objects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which you may ſurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, failed not to ply at thoſe Stairs where 'twas ſeldom low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And though ſhe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times impoſed upon, and deceived by thoſe that neither needed nor
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34084:62"/>deſerved what ſhe gave, yet this did not diſcourage her from giving again; For ſhe ſaid, ſhe had rather relieve ten that only appeared meet objects and were not, than let one go unrelieved that was ſo indeed: For though they deceived her in her giving, God would not deceive her in accepting, what was ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done for his Name ſake.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Laſtly, the Poor</hi> which ſhe fed in great number, not only with frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and broken meat, but with liberal proviſion purpoſely made for them. She was a greatpitier, yea a great lover of the poor, and ſhe built a convenient houſe on purpoſe for them at her <hi>London</hi>-Seat, (as they had one at <hi>Leez</hi>) to ſhelter them from rain and heat while they received their dole, and when ſhe was at <hi>London</hi> with her Family, had in her abſence, whilſt no houſe kept for their ſakes alone: That is, twice a week, good Beef and Bread provided for the poor of four ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Pariſhes, and hath taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in her Will to have the ſame continued three months after her
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34084:63"/>deceaſe, and by the ſame Will hath given an hundred pounds to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to the Poor of <hi>Braintree, Felſted, Little-Leez,</hi> and <hi>Much-Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> at or ſhortly after her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>And though it cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be expected from one who had no Lands of Inheritance, to leave charitable foundations. Yet I may, without <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> ſay, that every year ſhe lived, after ſhe came to be Miſtreſs of the Eſtate, ſhe gave as much in charity as would have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Lands ſufficient to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed an Alms-houſe or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchool. And that pious and liberal foundation of <hi>Rochford</hi> Alms-houſe, which though founded legally by a Patent granted under the Broad Seal for its confirmation, by the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of that Family, of which ſhe bore the Title; was by the death of the Founder not endowed, yet as all her predeceſſors had done.</p>
            <p>She always paid the Alms-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their full deſigned Allowance, and ordered by her laſt Will it ſhould be ſo done for a year after her deceaſe. And I muſt here take
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34084:63"/>leave to add, to their great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the ſatisfaction of all that relate to that Family, that thoſe Right honourable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons, to whom the eſtate deſcends, have agreed to continue the ſame plentiful allowance: And if I were worthy to adviſe them, I would earneſtly perſwade them to make Legal Settlement, and endow it with Lands to the value of what they reſolve to allow, before they make the diviſion of the Eſtate.</p>
            <p>But methinks I hear it asked, what! had ſhe no <hi>Spots,</hi> no <hi>Scars,</hi> no <hi>real</hi> nor <hi>imputed Blemiſhes?</hi> how could ſhe live in ſuch an Age and not be <hi>corrupted</hi> or at leaſt <hi>tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced?</hi> neither <hi>ſcorched</hi> by the <hi>fire</hi> of infection, nor <hi>blackned</hi> by the ſmoak of <hi>revengeful detraction,</hi> for upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the guilty by her innocency? This <hi>overdoing</hi> is <hi>undoing,</hi> if you would make us <hi>believe</hi> ſhe had no <hi>faults,</hi> we ſhall ſooner <hi>believe</hi> you have no <hi>truth:</hi> And that all you have ſaid hath more of <hi>Romance,</hi> and what you <hi>fancy,</hi> than <hi>Narrative</hi> of what ſhe <hi>was</hi> or <hi>did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs 'tis next to a miracle to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34084:64"/>conſider, both how divine Grace enlarged her heart, and eſtabliſhed her goings, and reſtrained the tongues of others from reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſhewing diſlike of that in her, for which they deride and hate, not to ſay perſecute others.</p>
            <p>But I muſt implore that <hi>candour</hi> while I embalm her memory, with the ſweet <hi>Oyntment</hi> of her own good name, you granted to her <hi>virtues</hi> which acquired it, and made it ſo fragrant.</p>
            <p>I therefore ſolemnly proteſt, I have ſpoke the truth (<hi>though the truth in love;</hi> as I am allowed and requir'd <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15.) and have not knowingly diſguiſed or falſified, nor dipt my pen in flattering colours.</p>
            <p>But ſince you are ſo inquiſitive, and ſeem to deny me the juſt and civil freedom, to draw a veil of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence over her imperfections, and your <hi>curioſity</hi> will be <hi>peeping</hi> under that <hi>ſacred Pall,</hi> which ſhould <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> and <hi>ſhroud</hi> the worſt of men from being pryed into; and the <hi>Vault,</hi> and <hi>Grave,</hi> that place of darkneſs and forgetfulneſs, which ſhould bury all defects and render

            </p>
            <p>But theſe three things I ſay, and will adhere to.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſhe was not notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defective in any Grace or Virtue, but as eminent in all as moſt have been for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y ſingle one: She was not only <hi>aliquid in omnibus;</hi> but <hi>omnis in ſingulis,</hi> ſhe did abound in every Grace. Which St. <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi> admires in <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> and St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> in <hi>Nepotian: Itain ſingulis virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus eminebat, quaſi caeter as non haberet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> She was never <hi>ſtained</hi> with any ſcandalous deformity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother rare mercy: For though ſhe did <hi>humanum pati, ſlip</hi> now and then, or <hi>ſtumble</hi> if you will, ſhe <hi>fell</hi> not, much leſs <hi>lay</hi> or <hi>wallowed</hi> to defile her Garments, which I teſtifie not only from mine own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34084:65"/>but her own Pen.</p>
            <q rend="margQuotes">After God had thus ſavingly (I hope) wrought upon me, I went on conſtantly, comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in my Chriſtian courſe, though I had many doubts and fears to contend with: And did truly obey that Precept of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out my Salvation with fear and trembling, yet God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to carry me ſtill onward: And though I too often broke my good reſolutions, I never renounced them, and though I too often tript in my Journey to Heaven, yet I never forſook my purpoſe of going thither.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Her very <hi>defects</hi> and <hi>failings</hi> were ſuch as others might be <hi>proud</hi> of, her <hi>Weeds</hi> would have been <hi>Flowers,</hi> and her <hi>Thiſtles</hi> appeared <hi>Roſes</hi> in another Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p>For I never heard her blamed for more than <hi>two faults,</hi> by the moſt curious obſervers and inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of her diſpoſition or beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Exceſs of Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Defect of Anger,</hi> or what
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34084:65"/>was reduceable to thoſe two, Two goodly faults! But even theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Apology more eaſily than they need it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What was reputed the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable exceſs of her <hi>Charity,</hi> was her credulous eaſineſs, to believe moſt people <hi>good,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>better</hi> than they were. I confeſs ſhe did bend a little to this right hand er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but if it were a <hi>bad effect,</hi> it proceeded from a <hi>good cauſe.</hi> For as 'tis obſerved, that as they who are conſcious to themſelves of ſome great evils, ſcarce can eſteem any leſs <hi>nocent</hi> than themſelves; ſo they that have clear and <hi>innocent</hi> hearts, are ready to judge the like of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Charity thinketh no evil,</hi> and ſhe uſed this good opinion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as an inſtrument to make them what ſhe was ſo willing to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſhe thought them: And though ſhe would never <hi>deſpair</hi> of any man, while ſhe found them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Awe</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Word,</hi> for even thoſe may receive ſome nouriſhment, who eat againſt Stomach, and the Sieve under the Pump may be cleanſed though it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34084:66"/>hold no water; yet if ſhe obſerved a perſon to ſcorn or deride the Scriptures, deſpiſe Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and turn all that was ſacred into ridicule—<hi>She uſed,</hi> as her Phraſe was, <hi>to ſet her mark upon that man:</hi> And I muſt further add, She was neither ſo <hi>often</hi> nor ſo <hi>much</hi> miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in her judgment of perſons, as ſome ſuppoſed ſhe was; they more miſ interpreting her civility, than ſhe did the others ſanctity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For her <hi>Defect of Anger,</hi> which implies, if it be faulty, <hi>want of zeal againſt ſin, and ſinners,</hi> and ſo 'tis an unjuſt charge; for though I confeſs ſhe could not rage and ſtorm, and diſcover her anger, as ſome perſons do, who verifie the ſaying, <hi>Ira furor brevis, Anger is a kind of madneſs;</hi> for her <hi>ſedate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſerene mind,</hi> and <hi>ſweet,</hi> and <hi>amicable diſpoſition</hi> was ſcarce forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what was ſo contrary to her nature; yet would ſhe make deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impreſſions of her diſpleaſure for great faults, than thoſe who appeared moſt furious, like a ſtill ſoaking ſhower, which will wet more than a driving ſtorm. And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34084:66"/>therefore 'twas obſerv'd, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſervant had been faulty, they had rather have paſſed the Gantlet thrice of their Lord's moſt furious expreſſions, than have once been ſent for to their <hi>Lady's Cloſet,</hi> whoſe treatment was <hi>ſoft words,</hi> but <hi>hard arguments</hi> againſt their <hi>faults,</hi> and like that ſilent lightning, which without the noiſe of Thunder melts the Blade, and ſindgeth not the Scabbard; Her reproofs were neither the <hi>frightful hiſſing,</hi> nor the <hi>venom'd ſting,</hi> but the <hi>penetrating oyl of Scorpions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This little is enough to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate her, almoſt commendable faults; and 'tis a great evidence of her goodneſs, that theſe things were imputed as Blemiſhes, for they who would not ſpare her in theſe little errors, ſhewed plainly that ſhe was not chargeable with more or greater.</p>
            <p>I am now arrived at the laſt Stage of this Mournful Journey, to give an account of her ſurpriſing, and never enough lamented death.</p>
            <p>What preſages ſhe might have of its near approach ſhe never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34084:67"/>but her preparations for it had been long habitual, it was one of the moſt conſtant ſubjects of her Thinking, and ſhe uſed to call her walking to meditate of it, her going to <hi>take a turn with death,</hi> and it could never <hi>ſurpriſe, or take her unprepared, who was always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet there are ſome paſſages, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our remarks of the <hi>watchful kindneſs</hi> of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> over his <hi>own,</hi> allarming them to trim their Lamps (as the wiſe Virgins did) againſt the coming of the Bridegroom, and allowing them fit opportunities to do it, as he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally did to her.</p>
            <p>I ſhall on this conſideration very ſeaſonably add another Tranſcript out of her Ladyſhips Diary, which contains an account of the laſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of her health, being written but the very day before ſhe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ill, and in which <hi>God</hi> did, it ſeems, in a moſt remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>impreſs</hi> the thoughts of her approaching <hi>diſſolution</hi> on her Soul, though there were no viſible ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of it then upon her Body.</p>

                  <p>AS ſoon as I awaked, I bleſſed God; then I meditated and endeavoured by thinking of ſome of the great mercies of my life, to ſtir up my heart to return Glory to God. And thoſe thoughts had this effect upon me, to melt my heart much by God's love, and to warm it with love to him.</p>
                  <p>Then I prayed, and I was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in that duty to pour out my Soul to God, and my heart was in it, carried out to praiſe God, and I was large in recounting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God's ſpecial mercies to me. And whilſt I was doing ſo, I found God mighty upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and my heart in a much more than ordinary manner, carried out to admire God for his goodneſs, and to love him. And I found his love make great impreſſions in my Breaſt. And melting me into an unuſual plenty of tears.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe mercies which in an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial manner I was grateful for, were the Creation and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34084:68"/>of the World, and for the Goſpel and the Sacraments, and for free Grace, and the Covenant of Grace, and for the excellent means of it I had enjoyed: and for the great patience God hath exerciſed towards me before and ſince my Converſion. And for checks of Conſcience when I had ſinned, and for repentance when I had done ſo. And for a ſanctified affliction and ſupports under it. And for ſo large a portion of worldly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
                  <p>After I had begged a Bleſſing upon the publick Ordinances, I went to hear Mr. <hi>Woodroof:</hi> his Text was, <hi>Paſs the time of your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here in fear</hi>— Then after a ſummary account of the Sermon, follows: In the Afternoon I heard again the ſame Perſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Text. And then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a conciſe and methodical reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation of that Sermon alſo. "And after that— I was in a ſerious and affected frame at both the Sermons, and was by them convinced of the excellency of fearing God, and of ſpending of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34084:68"/>the remainder of the term of my life in his ſervice. And did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to endeavour to ſpend the remaining part of my time bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>At both his Prayers I prayed with fervency: afterwards I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and meditated upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and prayed them over.</p>
                  <p>And I had alſo this Evening large Meditations of death, and of Eternity; which thoughts had this effect upon me, to make me in an extraordinary awakened frame, in which the things of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other life were much realized to me, and did make very deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon me. And my <hi>Soul</hi> did <hi>follow hard after God,</hi> for Grace to ſerve him better than ever yet I had done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Lord be pleaſed to hear my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which did not come out of fained Lips: and to hear the voyce of my weeping, for more holineſs, and for being more weaned from the world, and all things in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Supper, I committed my ſelf to God.</p>

            <p>This was written the very laſt day of her health, Monday Morning: in which we ſee how God realized to her, and gave her extraordinary impreſſions of Death, Eternity, and the Life to come, when he was about to bring her to it; for the very next day ſhe began to be ill of that Sickneſs of which ſhe died.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>excellent Lady</hi> was far from their humour whoſe <hi>Conſciences</hi> are ſo bad and <hi>unquiet</hi> company, that they hate ſolitude, and dare not be alone: For ſhe loved, and even hugged her retirements as her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſatisfactions. And though, when ſhe was called to it, ſhe would deny her ſelf and particular inclination (as in the Univerſe Individuals do, to obey the Laws of univerſal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to comply with a duty of a larger ſpread; as is related of the devout Marqueſs of <hi>Renti</hi> in the two years time he ſpent in repairing the ſeat of his Anceſtors, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion he cheerfully ſuffered as a willing mortification, being a duty he owed to the Station in which God had placed him.</p>
            <p>So <hi>ſhe</hi> chearfully ſuſtained the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34084:69"/>
               <hi>hurry</hi> of buſineſs which was inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the acquitting her ſelf of the truſt repoſed in her, by her Lord's laſt Will.</p>
            <p>But never did Bird take Wing, when diſ-intangled from a Net, with greater cheerfulneſs, nor chirp out the pleaſures of its unconfined freedom, more merrily than ſhe did ſolace her ſelf, when ſhe had eſcaped the noiſe and croud of affairs, which ruffled and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyled her quiet, and ſuſpended the enjoyment of her ſelf. And when her deareſt Siſter was in the beginning of the laſt winter, about to leave her; her laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well ſhe took was in theſe words: Now I have done my <hi>drudgery</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her buſineſs) I will ſet to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of my preparations for <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and ſhe made it the repeated buſineſs of the laſt winter.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the laſt <hi>March,</hi> ſhe ſet to the making of her Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and ſigned and fealed it on the twelfth day of the ſame Month, and on the Tueſday in Paſſion week, <hi>March</hi> 26. was taken with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, loſs of Appetite, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34084:70"/>aguiſh diſtemper, and had four or five Fits, which yet in that ſeaſon were judged both by Phyſitians and her Friends, more advantageous to her health than dangerous to her life. And in this ſtate ſhe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freed from her fits in her own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and in our hopes, till Friday the twelfth of <hi>April,</hi> on which day ſhe roſe with good ſtrength, and after ſitting up ſome time, being laid upon her Bed, diſcourſing cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and piouſly, one of the laſt ſentences ſhe ſpake was this, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the Curtain with her hand.</p>
            <q>Well, Ladies, if I were one hour in Heaven, I would not be again with you as well as I love you.</q>
            <p>Having then received a kind viſit from a Neighbouring Lady, at her departure ſhe roſe from her Bed to her Chair, in which being ſet, ſhe ſaid ſhe would go into her Bed, but firſt would deſire one of the Miniſters then in the houſe to go to prayer with her, and asking the company which they would have, preſently
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34084:70"/>reſolv'd her ſelf to have him who was going away, becauſe the other would ſtay and pray with her dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and immediately he being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and come, her Ladyſhip ſitting in her Chair, by reaſon of her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for otherwiſe ſhe always knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, holding an Orange in her hand, to which ſhe ſmelt, almoſt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Prayer ſhe was heard to fetch a <hi>ſigh,</hi> or <hi>groan,</hi> which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <hi>devotional,</hi> as ſhe uſed to do at other times. But a Lady looking up, who kneeled by her, ſaw her look pale, and her hand hang down, at which ſhe ſtarted up, affrighted, and all applyed themſelves to help, and the moſt afflictively diſtreſſed of them all, if I may ſo ſpeak, when all our ſorrows were ſuperlative, catch't her right hand, which then had loſt its pulſe, and never recovered it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Thus lived, thus died this Right Honourable Lady, this Heroick Woman, this bleſſed Saint, <hi>this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable pattern of flaming zeal for the glory of God, and burning charity for the good of</hi> (<hi>men;</hi> in the actual <hi>exerciſe of prayer,</hi> according to her own deſire,
